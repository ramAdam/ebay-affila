# eBay Affilate

### Learn how to build this!

This is a fork of the ebay clone. I have taken out prisma and supabase deps to use it to connect with Ebay API.

If you'd like a step-by-step guide on how to build the original repo with backend service 

follow the link below 

```
git clone https://github.com/John-Weeks-Dev/ebay-clone.git
```
To run this fork, do the following:

```
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
